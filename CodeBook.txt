Data description
The data for this assignment comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0, collected by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, available at
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.
The data was collected on 30 volunteers whose movements were measured to train and test models to predict in which of six "human activities" a subject was engaged:

Walking
Walking upstairs
Walking downstairs
Sitting
Standing
Laying

The subjects were fitted with a Body Accelerometer and a Body Gyroscope. Each subject engaged in all six activities while being monitored among 17 different measured variables. The available data sets contain the following variable prefixes:

(The following several lines, up to the list of signals, is directly from the study's README file.)
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 

Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

where "X", "Y", and "Z" refer to spatial planes in which the variable was measured.

The measures for each variable captured in the data were the following 17 metrics:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between two vectors.

In total, each observation reflects one subject engaged in one activity, and consists of 561 measures labeled as "[variable prefix]-[measure]", eg, the first variable is labeled "tBodyAcc-X-mean()", the second "tBodyAcc-X-std()", etc.
The measured data sets are split into training and testing subsets in roughly a 70/30 ratio. While more data sets were available, for this project I used the following eight:

	X_train,	X_test
	y_train,	y_test
	subject_train,	subject_test
	activity_labels
	features

Study design
========================================================
run_analysis.R
The script run_analysis.R first reads in all eight data sets, and names the 561 columns in the train and test data sets with the 561 measures listed in the features data set.

Next, it creates subsets of the train and test data sets, selecting only the columns with either "-mean()" or "-sd()" in their name.

Next, it binds the appropriate subject ID vector and verbose activity label vector to the beginning of both the train and test data sets.

Next, it merges the train and test data sets to create a single data set. The two data sets' column variables are identical so there is no massaging to be done.

Next, it reduces the merged data only to the subject IDs, activity labels, and variables containing measure "-mean()". The resulting data set is called meanData. 

Since the suffix "-mean()" is now superfluous, the final step before writing the data is to remove "-mean()" from the column names.
